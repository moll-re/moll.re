# moll.re

My personal website. I initially wanted to host it on the server provided by ETH, but it only allows cgi-applications and getting it to work with django would have been a huge pain.

So instead I'm hosting this on the google-cloud free-tier vps with a static-ip. I set the DNS for `moll.re` to point to it. It works nicely now.


## Deployment
For deployment tips please have a look at the issues tab where I tried to document the issues I had while deploying.
